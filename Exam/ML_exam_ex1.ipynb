    "\n",
    "The exam is composed of two exercises (on separate notebooks) each one with a specific dataset. In total, there are three independent parts to complete:\n",
    "* Exercise 1 (8 points): regression\n",
    "* Exercise 2 part 1 (9 points): classification\n",
    "* Exercise 2 part 2 (3 points): clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "You can work directly on the notebooks. At the end of the 2-hour exam, you will have 5 minutes to upload it on Teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget that you have to complete the TWO notebooks to have the maximum grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many questions can be tackled even if the previous ones are not completed or not correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subject is long but don't worry if you cannot complete 100 % of the questions, try to do as much as you can. In case you are blocked at some point, don't panic. Just move on to the next question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid \"naive\" copy-pasting: you will not understand what you are doing and it will be a problem for the next questions. Notebooks that are cluttered with useless code that has been mindlessly copied from previous another notebook will be penalized. Moreover, similarities between student works are easy to spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"
